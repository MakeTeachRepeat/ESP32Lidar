# ESP32Lidar
This Repo is for Using the Serial of ESP32 to get data from YDLidar X4

Connect The Lidar from YDLidar to Pins 16 (RX) and 17 (TX), GND and 5V on the ESP32. Attach MOTOR_EN to Pin 18.

This code will need to be adapted if you want to run this on Teensy or Arduino boards due to the PWM used in the code.
